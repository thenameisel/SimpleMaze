//WELCOME TO THE SIMPLE SHROOMY DUNGEON MAZE GAME!!!

//WSAD to move around, P to pause, and ESC to quit while paused.

//Quite frankly the second most spageti code I have ever written.

//The first was the android final project. Dont ask.

//I feel like I will play with this more over the summer,
//make it into something, now that I have a better feeling for MonoGame. 

//The rubric said sound and/or animation, I went with animation,
//as I could show off some thing I made last year. 

//Yes. All the sprites are mine. I made them alllllll.

//Have fun!
